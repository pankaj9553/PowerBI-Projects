# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard is a Power BI project designed to provide a detailed view of road accident patterns across the United Kingdom.  
It helps identify key factors such as vehicle type, light conditions, road types, and area classifications influencing accident rates and casualties.

The dashboard serves as a useful tool for traffic management authorities, data analysts, and policymakers to make data-driven decisions for improving road safety and reducing accidents.

## Key Highlights
- **Total Casualties (CY):** 195.7K  
- **Total Accidents (CY):** 144.4K  
- **Fatal Casualties:** 2.9K  
- **Serious Casualties:** 27.0K  
- **Slight Casualties:** 165.8K  

Each of these metrics also shows a **year-over-year comparison**, highlighting a decline in total casualties and accident count compared to the previous year.

## Dashboard Insights

### 1. **Casualties by Vehicle Type**
- **Cars** account for the majority of casualties (**155.8K**), followed by **Vans (15.9K)** and **Bikes (15.6K)**.  
- **Bus** and **Agriculture vehicles** contribute a smaller proportion to the total accident count.  
- These insights suggest a strong correlation between the volume of car traffic and accident frequency.

### 2. **Casualties by Light Conditions**
- **74% of casualties** occurred during **daylight**, while **26%** happened in **dark conditions**.  
- The difference reflects either higher traffic volumes during daytime or improved visibility affecting accident severity.

### 3. **Casualties by Urban/Rural Area**
- **Urban areas** recorded **62%** of total casualties, compared to **38%** in rural regions.  
- This indicates that cities and populated areas face more frequent but possibly less severe accidents.

### 4. **Casualties by Road Type**
- **Single carriageway roads** have the highest casualty count (**145K**), significantly higher than other road types.  
- **Dual carriageways** (32K) and **Roundabouts** (13K) follow next, while **Slip roads** and **One-way streets** show minimal figures.  
- This highlights where road safety improvements may have the greatest impact.

### 5. **Casualties by Month (2021 vs 2022)**
- Monthly trends show slight variation across the year, with peaks observed around **April to August**.  
- Casualty numbers decline in the last quarter, reflecting seasonal effects such as reduced travel or better road conditions.

### 6. **Casualties by Location**
- A geographical map visualization pinpoints accident-prone areas across the UK.  
- Major clusters are visible around **London**, **Birmingham**, **Manchester**, and **Glasgow**, where traffic density is highest.

## Key Observations
1. Total casualties have **decreased by 11.9%** from the previous year, indicating improving safety measures.  
2. **Fatal casualties dropped by 33.3%**, showing positive progress in accident management and response.  
3. **Cars remain the main contributor** to overall accident numbers.  
4. Most accidents occur under **daylight** and **urban** conditions, suggesting heavy traffic as a leading factor.  
5. **Single carriageways** are the most accident-prone road type.

- Interactive map showing accident density by location  
- KPIs for total, fatal, serious, and slight casualties  
- Breakdown by **Vehicle Type**, **Light Condition**, **Road Type**, and **Area Classification**  

---

## Business Applications
- **Government Agencies:** Identify high-risk zones and plan road safety initiatives.  
- **Traffic Departments:** Optimize patrol deployment and improve signage or road lighting.  
- **Urban Planners:** Evaluate road infrastructure and traffic design for accident reduction.  
- **Researchers:** Study the relationship between vehicle type, lighting, and accident severity.  

---

## Future Enhancements
